<p>Iqra is a Qur’an reading and research tool, one of the hundreds of software applications made for reading our Noble Book, the Qur'an. The main features that distinguish it from other software include: marking the root of a word in the Qur'an text, displaying all pages where a word appears in the Qur'an on a single screen, and enabling offline functionality.</p>

<p>For ease of memorization and recitation, standard Mushaf pages are used in Iqra. The technical word for "mushaf" is "codex", a written form of the Qur'an text. "Mujam" is an index showing the occurrences of each word.</p>

<h3 id=mushaf>1. Mushaf pages</h3>

<p>Software start link:
<a href="/Kuran" target="iqraTop">https://okuyun.org</a>
<br>Introduction videos:
<a href="/Kuran/video.html" target="NewTab">https://okuyun.org/video.html</a>
</p>

<p>
  The start page appears like this (quick look): <br><br>
  <img src="docs.EN/start.png" alt="Start ekranı">
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The yellow globe icon changes the language, the yellow arrow goes to the mushaf panel</li>
  <li>Show in Mushaf: Go to the specified page or verse number,
    or to the last bookmark using the star icon.</li>
  <li>Find in Mujam: Search for words derived from the given Arabic root. </li>
  <li>Find in Finder: Search for words in the Qur'an text or in the translation.</li>
  <li>Other buttons access the advanced features of the software</li>
</ul>
<p>When the Mushaf is opened, if the screen is wide enough both the Qur'an page and the translation appear.
If both cannot fit together, only one is shown (See: <a href="#panel">Panels</a>)
In order to change the panel width, drag the yellow button with the double arrows. While the Mushaf is open, it is possible to go to the next or previous page, or specify another surah, juz, verse, or page number.</p>
<p>  <img src="docs.EN/dialog.png"><br>
When the Page number at the top is tapped or clicked, a navigation dialog appears, similar to the start page. All search operations are managed by entering information into the single box in this dialog. Based on the data, the software decides which type of search or navigation is required. In the same dialog, it is also possible to use voice search to look up words using the microphone. Voice search is applicable only for Arabic text.
</p>

<p>The start link can include page or verse numbers:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="index.html#p=578" target="iqraTop">
  #p=578</a> (the page with the given number &ndash; the image above)</li>
  <li><a href="index.html#v=27:28&r=ktb" target="iqraTop">
  #v=27:28</a> (Surah 27, verse 28 &ndash; the image below)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <img src="docs.EN/Iqra_ktb.png" alt="Iqra ekranı"><br>
In this image, the page menu is visible, used mainly for external resources. Slide the yellow button with the double arrow to change the panel width.
</p>

<p>Top-right buttons:
<ul>
  <li>☆ &nbsp; Add/remove/select bookmark</li>
  <li>T &nbsp; Show/hide/select translation</li>
  <li><xs>A</xs>A &nbsp; Increase/normal text size (not visible on narrow screens)</li>
  <li>☰ &nbsp; Page menu: Help, Share, Variants, External resources... </li>
  <li>&lt; &nbsp; Move to the search panel (Yellow arrow)</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>The root and meaning of Arabic words can be found by clicking with a mouse on desktop or tapping on mobile. Verses and words found in the search panel (Mujam or Finder) are highlighted in color in that panel. On narrow screens both verse and translation panels do not fit together; the T menu (or swiping) is used to switch between verses and translations. Fonts scale with screen width, so holding the phone sideways provides a better view.</p>
<p>
  <img src="docs.EN/Iqra_dar.png" alt="Iqra dar" /><br>
In this image, the context menu is shown after two words are selected.
For the context menu: if there is a mouse, right-click; otherwise press and hold the word or touch with two fingers. The selected text is copied to the clipboard or sent to search modules.
</p>
<h3 id="arama">2. Search methods</h3>
<p>The software supports three types of search:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Plain text search (in three languages) &ndash; Finder</li>
  <li>Search by Arabic word root &ndash; Mujam</li>
  <li>Search for verses that share similar words</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="rehber">2.1 Finder (Three languages)</h3>

<p>The plain text search in Arabic text or in the Turkish-English translation was presented as a graduation project by Abdurrahman Rajab (Completion in June 2020)</p>

<p>
  <img src="docs.EN/Finder_meta.png" alt="Rehber">
</p>

<p>In the Mushaf panel, <a href="/Kuran/#p=47&r=ktb" target="iqraTop">the root "ktb"</a> is highlighted, and then the word "da'îfan" is selected on page 47. From the word menu you can easily switch to the <a href="/Kuran/#b=DEyfA" target="iqraTop">Finder panel</a> to see all 4 occurrences. Tap the verse number in Finder to return to the Mushaf.</p>

<p>A microphone icon enables voice search (Arabic, Turkish, English).</p>

<h3 id="mucem">2.2 Mujam (Arabic only)</h3>

<p>The Mujam method works based on the roots of selected Arabic words. This method is designed for those who are familiar with the Qur'anic language or wish to learn it. Each of the 604 boxes shown on the page corresponds to a page from the Qur'an. The searched root does not appear at all on white pages. The color of each box is proportional to the number of words on the corresponding page. Details are on the <a href="guideM.html">related page</a></p>

<p>
  <img src="docs/Mucem_ktb.png" alt="Mucem menu" />
</p>

<h3 id="benzerlik">2.3 Similar verses</h3>

<p>Some examples regarding verse similarity were given on <a href="benzerlik.html">this page</a>.
Is it possible to automatically find similarities like this?
The answer is yes; with the similarity module it is possible to find verses containing multiple similar words:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="docs.EN/Iqra_simi.png" alt="Iqra simi" />
</p>
<p>On the example page, three verses are marked with blue numbers.
For instance, for the verse 27:30, three similar verses are shown. The basmala appearing in this verse, of course, is the same as the first verse of the Book. As in Mujam, the similarity module also works with Arabic word roots, so it is used only in the Arabic text; there is not yet a similarity module for translations.
</p>

<h3 id="panel">3. Software capabilities</h3>

<p>As a Progressive Web Application, its features include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When opened from a web page its components are automatically downloaded</li>
  <li>No manual updates required; new versions are downloaded automatically</li>
  <li>Can open in its own window like an app</li>
  <li>Can operate offline without an Internet connection</li>
  <li>Compatible with every screen size from desktop to phone</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's summarize the software's capabilities using the examples below:</p>

<b>Panels &ndash; Search, Translation, Qur'an</b>

<p>The most obvious feature of the software is 
  <a href="design/">the three-panel design</a>:<br>
  <img src="design/wide.png" alt="three panels together" class=large /></p>
  
<p>Panels (three letters):<br>
A: Access/Search, T: Translation, K: Qur'an
</p>
<p>
When viewing the Search panel only one of the following pages is visible:
Start, Finder, Mujam, Topics, Notes, Stars, Book...
(Book pages do not work offline)
</p>
<p>If the screen is wide enough, all three panels are shown simultaneously. A laptop will fit two panels, a phone only one. In this case, yellow button or screen swiping are used to switch between panels.</p>
<br>
<b>Mujam ↔ Mushaf Transition</b>
<p><img src="docs/Mucem-Mushaf.png" alt="Mucem-Mushaf" class=large /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Mujam: The shown <strong>ktb</strong> (kef-tâ-bâ) root and its various derivatives occur 319 times across 205 pages. In the image the selected page 59 contains the root 6 times; lighter colored pages contain fewer instances... We can read the related verses on the Mushaf page by clicking the yellow box. (There is also a context menu for the external resources) The Corpus link at the bottom right leads to the reference page we used.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mushaf: On the open page 59, 6 words derived from the "ktb" root are marked in blue. After selecting a word in the Mushaf, you can switch to the Mujam and Finder search methods from the context menu. Searching for similar verses will be added to the verse menu.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<b>Mushaf-Finder Transition</b>
<p><img src="docs/Finder-Mushaf.png" alt="Rehber-Mushaf" class=large /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Mushaf: On the open page 382 the letter sequence “metâ hâzâ” has been selected. From the context menu it is easy to switch to the Finder panel.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finder: The image shows the verses where the sequence “metâ hâzâ” occurs. By tapping the verse number or the highlighted text you can return to the Mushaf or switch to external software from the menu.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sss">4. Frequently asked questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What prompted the development of this software?
    <p>In Qur'anic recitation, one encounters verses that resemble each other.
      To explain one verse by another, it is necessary to quickly move between similar verses and see them all together.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>What distinguishes Iqra from other Qur'an software?
    <p>* Displaying the roots of Arabic words
      <br>* Functioning independently of the internet
      <br>* Automatically downloading updates for new versions</p>
  </li>
  <li>What does Mujam mean?
    <p>An index showing in which verses each word occurs</p>
  </li>
  <li>Source of Mujam data?
    <p><a href="https://corpus.quran.com/download/">corpus.quran.com</a>
    (GNU License is included below)</p>
  </li>
  <li>What does the Mujam table mean?
    <p>Each page is a box, each juz is a row</p>
  </li>
  <li>Why the Medina mushaf?
    <p>We chose the Medina mushaf for three reasons: <br>
      * Tajwid marks make reading easier <br>
      * Most common international writing style <br>
      * Compatible with different variant readings</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="kullanım">5. Use cases</h3>
