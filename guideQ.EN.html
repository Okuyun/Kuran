<p>Iqra is one of the hundreds of software applications made for reading our Noble Book, the Qur'an. The main features that distinguish it from other software are: marking the root of a word on the Qur'an text, showing all pages where a word appears in the Qur'an on a single screen, and working in an offline environment.</p>

<p>For ease of memorization and recitation, we used standard Mushaf pages. </p>

<h3 id=mushaf>1. Mushaf pages</h3>

<p>Software start link:
<a href="/Kuran" target="iqraTop">https://okuyun.org</a>
<br>Introduction videos:
<a href="/Kuran/video.html" target="NewTab">https://okuyun.org/video.html</a>
</p>

<p>
  The start page appears like this on a phone held sideways: <br><br>
  <img src="docs/start.png" alt="Start ekranı">
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The yellow globe icon changes the language, the yellow arrow goes to the mushaf panel</li>
  <li>Show in Mushaf: Show the location specified by page or verse number,<br>
    or the last marked page using the star icon
  </li>
  <li>Find in Mucem: Search for words derived from the given Arabic root</li>
  <li>Find in Guide: Search for words in the Qur'an text or in the translation</li>
  <li>Other buttons access the advanced features of the software</li>
</ul>
<p>When the Mushaf is opened, if the screen is wide enough both the Qur'an page and the translation appear.
If both cannot fit together, only one is shown (See: <a href="#panel">Panels</a>)
While the Mushaf is open, it is possible to go to the next or previous page, or specify another surah, juz, verse, or page number.</p>
<p>  <img src="docs/iqra V4.7.png"><br>
  All search operations are managed by entering information into the single box in this dialog that resembles the start page. Based on the entered information, the software decides which type of search or navigation is required. In the same dialog, it is also possible to search spoken words using the microphone. Voice search is applicable only for Arabic text.
</p>

<p>The start link can include page or verse numbers:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="index.html#v=27:28&r=ktb" target="iqraTop">
  #v=27:28</a> (Surah 27, verse 28 &ndash; first image below)</li>
  <li><a href="index.html#p=378" target="iqraTop">
  #p=578</a> (the page with the given number &ndash; second image)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <img src="docs/Iqra_ktb.png" alt="Iqra ekranı" style="max-width: min(100%, 604px)"><br>
In this image, the page menu, the clicked word information, and the marker used for prostration verses on verse 25 are visible.
</p>

<p>The meaning of the buttons visible at the top right:
<ul>
  <li>☆ &nbsp; Add/remove/select bookmark</li>
  <li>T &nbsp; Show/hide/select translation</li>
  <li><xs>A</xs>A &nbsp; Increase/normal text size (not visible on narrow screens)</li>
  <li>☰ &nbsp; Page menu: Help, Share, External resources, Version... </li>
  <li>&gt; &nbsp; Move to another panel (<s>Pink button</s> Yellow arrow)</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>The root and meaning of Arabic words can be found by clicking with a mouse on desktop or tapping on mobile. Verses and words found in the search panel (Mucem or Guide) are highlighted in color in that panel. On narrow screens both verse and translation columns do not fit together; the T menu (or screen scrolling) is needed to switch between verses and translations. Fonts scale with screen width, so holding the phone sideways provides a better view.</p>
<p>
  <img src="docs/Iqra_dar.png" alt="Iqra dar" /><br>
In this image, the context menu is shown after two words are selected.
For the context menu: if there is a mouse, right-click; otherwise long-press the word or touch with two fingers. The selected text is copied to the clipboard or sent to search modules.

<h3 id="arama">2. Search methods</h3>
<p>The software supports three types of search:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Plain text search (in three languages) &ndash; Guide</li>
  <li>Search by Arabic word root &ndash; Mucem</li>
  <li>Search for verses similar on a word-by-word basis</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="rehber">2.1 Guide (Three languages)</h3>

<p>The plain text search in Arabic text or in the Turkish-English translation was presented as a graduation project by Abdurrahman Rajab (Completion date: June 2020)</p>

<p class=center>
  <img src="docs/Finder_meta.png" alt="Rehber" class=large />
  Figure 3. <a href="index.html#b=Einda%20{ll~ahi" target="iqraTop">Rehber</a>
</p>

<p>In the right Mushaf window, the word “indallah” is selected on page 47. From the context menu we can easily switch to the Guide window. By tapping the verse number or the highlighted text you can return to the Mushaf or switch to external software from the menu.</p>

<p class=center>
  <img src="docs/Resizable panes.png" alt="Resizable" />
  Drag the point with the double arrows to change the panel width
</p>

<p>Arabic-Turkish-English voice search feature has been added (Details are on the Guide page)</p>

<h3 id="mucem">2.2 Mucem (Arabic only)</h3>

<p>The Mucem method works based on the roots of selected Arabic words. This method is designed for those who know or want to learn the Qur'anic language. Each of the 604 boxes shown on the page corresponds to a page from the Qur'an. A searched root does not appear at all on white pages. The color of each box is proportional to the number of words on the corresponding page. Details are on the <a href="guideM.html">related page</a></p>

<p>
  <img src="docs/Mucem_ktb.png" alt="Mucem menu" />
</p>

<h3 id="benzerlik">2.3 Similar verses</h3>

<p>Some examples regarding verse similarity were given on <a href="benzerlik.html">this page</a>.
Is it possible to automatically find similarities like this?
The answer is yes; with the similarity module it is possible to find verses containing multiple similar words:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="docs/Iqra_simi.png" alt="Iqra simi" />
</p>
<p>In the example page, there are three verses with blue-colored numbers.
For instance, for the shown verse 30, three different similar verses were found. The basmala appearing in this verse, of course, is the same as the first verse of the Book. As in Mucem, the similarity module also works with Arabic word roots, so it is used only in the Arabic text; there is not yet a similarity module for translations.
</p>

<h3 id="panel">3. Software capabilities</h3>

<p>Because it is a PWA (Progressive Web Application), its features include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When opened from a web page its components are automatically downloaded</li>
  <li>No manual updates required; new versions are downloaded automatically</li>
  <li>Can open in its own window like an app</li>
  <li>Can operate offline without an Internet connection</li>
  <li>Compatible with every screen size from desktop to phone</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's summarize the software's capabilities using the examples below:</p>

<b>Panels &ndash; Search, Translation, Qur'an</b>

<p>The most obvious feature of the software is the three-panel design:<br><br>
  <img src="design/wide.png" alt="üç panel bir arada" class=large /></p>
  
<p>Let's denote the three panels with three letters:<br>
A: Search, T: Translation (meal), K: Qur'an
</p>
<p>
When viewing the Search panel only one of the following pages is visible:
Start, Guide, Mucem, Topics, Notes, Stars, Book...
(Book pages do not work offline)
</p>
<p>If the screen is wide enough, all three panels are shown simultaneously. 
  A laptop will fit two panels, a phone only one.
  In this case, pink buttons or screen swiping are used to switch between panels.<p>
<br>
<b>Mucem-Mushaf Transition</b>
<p><img src="docs/Mucem-Mushaf.png" alt="Mucem-Mushaf" class=large /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Mucem: The shown <strong>ktb</strong> (kef-tâ-bâ) root and its various derivatives occur 319 times across 205 pages. In the image the selected page 59 contains the root 6 times; lighter colored pages contain fewer instances... We can read the verses concerned by clicking the yellow box to go to the Mushaf page. (There is also a context menu to read on external resources) The Corpus link at the bottom right leads to the reference page we used.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mushaf: On the open page 59, 6 words derived from the "ktb" root are marked in blue. After selecting a word in the Mushaf, you can switch to the Mucem and Guide search methods from the context menu. Searching for similar verses will be added to the verse menu.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<b>Mushaf-Guide Transition</b>
<p><img src="docs/Finder-Mushaf.png" alt="Rehber-Mushaf" class=large /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Mushaf: On the open page 382 the letter sequence “metâ hâzâ” has been selected. From the context menu it is easy to switch to the Guide window.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Guide: The image shows the verses where the sequence “metâ hâzâ” occurs. By tapping the verse number or the highlighted text you can return to the Mushaf or switch to external software from the menu.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sss">4. Frequently asked questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>What need gave rise to this project?
    <p>In Qur'anic recitation, one encounters verses that resemble each other.
      To explain one verse by another, it is necessary to quickly move between similar verses and see them all together.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>What distinguishes Iqra from other Qur'an software?
    <p>* Showing the roots of Arabic words
      <br>* Working independently from the internet
      <br>* Automatically downloading new versions</p>
  </li>
  <li>What does Mucem mean?
    <p>An index showing in which verses each word occurs</p>
  </li>
  <li>Source of Mucem data?
    <p><a href="https://corpus.quran.com/download/">corpus.quran.com</a>
    (GNU License is included below)</p>
  </li>
  <li>What does the Mucem table mean?
    <p>Each page is a box, each juz is a row</p>
  </li>
  <li>Why the Medina mushaf?
    <p>We chose the Medina mushaf for three reasons: <br>
      * Tajwid marks make reading easier <br>
      * Most common international writing style <br>
      * Compatible with different qira'at narrations</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="kullanım">5. Use cases</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Daily reading: I bookmark where I left off and continue the next day from the bookmarked page

  <li>Research: meanings and roots of words, Mucem, similar verses
  
  <li>Finding verses: by typing on the keyboard, or by voice search
  
  <li>Topics: viewing all verses of a selected group together
  
  <li>Lessons: direct access to verses from pages written on various topics
  
  <li>External resources: Missing features such as additional translations, audio recitation, qira'at differences, manuscripts are completed by links to other sites. If the relevant site has a mushaf page display feature, it appears in the page menu.<br><br>
    <img src="docs/kaynaklar.png" alt="Dış kaynaklar" class=large><br>
